# Testing

The following is a record of the various tests that were preformed on the R/C car during the spring quarter of the senior CapStone Project. 

The testing done to the car was to judge the competency pf the car based on requirements set by the student during Fall quarter. 

Testing done to the R/C car was a speed test that utilizes a large open space, about 100 feet, and a stop watch. This test is done to confirm the top speed of the car, the maximum operational time, as well as acceleration of the car. There was a destructive crash test that tests for the deformation of the chassis and the drivetrain of the car.
