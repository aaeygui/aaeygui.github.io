# Budget/Schedule



## Schedule
The following Gantt chart is the planned schedule for the R/C Baja Competition Car project. The Gantt chart is broken up into quarterly tasks that have a planned start and end date based on the submission period for each subtask.

### Fall: 
This quarter sees the conception of the proposal and related calculations for the car to gain an understanding of how the car's construction and material selection will interact with with the Competition track. These calculations are based on requirements set for the car.

### Winter: 
This quarter sees the construction of car. This process will take the entirety of the quarter with the conclusion of the quarter resulting in a completed car that is drivable 

### Spring:
This quarter sees the testing and presentation of the car. The testing done during this quarter is based on the requirements done during Fall quarter. The preentation of the car will be done as an in-class presentation that details the entire project from conception to testing. The MET program at CWU also requires the use of SOURCE to present Senior Projects.
