# Construction

This page details the timeline and process for the construction of the R/C Baja COmpetition Car. 

There were many processes that were considered for the construction. The processes that was ultimately chosen was Laser cutting, 3D-Printing, and CNC turning. THese processes were chosen due to their accessability as well as the need for toleranceing and GD&T during the construction prcoess.

Throuhgout the process of manufacturing, there was one problem that could not be avoided, which that these parts are manufactured during the winter. Due to the timeframe of construction, the ambiant temperature in the workshop used was low enough to freeze specific components of the workshop. This was mitagated to an extent, but the ultimate issue was still there.
